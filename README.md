# Light Show Jukebox Website

This project is to be used in conjunction with the Light Show Jukebox Plugin 
designed for FPP (Falcon Pi Player) instances. This software, shows various information about 
the show and allows viewers to select the songs they want to hear.


## Not Remote Falcon

While this show has some of the same features as Remote Falcon, this is not the same project 
as Remote Falcon. One of the aspects of Remote Falcon is that some website hosts do not allow you 
to run Java or Node.js based application. This project utilizes PHP which is allowed by most 
hosting providers, without much additional configuration.
